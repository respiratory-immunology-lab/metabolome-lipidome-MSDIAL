# Secondary MS1 Lipid identification with Lipidmaps
After processing the Lipidomic LCMS data using the MS-DIAL pipeline, we can obtain secondary annotations for MS1 data by matching the mass data to LIPID MAPS Structure Database (LMSD). Before this step, you should run your data through the GNPS MS/MS secondary annotation steps (workflow here).

The LIPID MAPS Structure Database (file version LMSD 2022-02-16) was formated and saved as a .RDS file (available here[...]).
If a new version of the LMSD is available you can find the code for formatting here[...].

To facilitate adding these annotations to the SummarizedExperiment object, a function is available at the top of the page. Its use will be explained here.
