# Secondary MS/MS feature identification with GNPS

After processing our metabolomics LCMS data using the MS-DIAL pipeline, we can get secondary annotations for our MS/MS data using the feature-based
molecular networking (FBMN) workflow available from the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking team.

To use this tool, you will first have to register for a new account if you do not already have one.
You can do this [here](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/user/register.jsp).

GNPS have a tutorial on the use of MS-DIAL data [here](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-ms-dial/),
but we will cover the most important steps here. 

We will look at how to export your MS-DIAL output for use with GNPS, running your data through the FBMN workflow, and then
incorporating the annotations into the `SummarizedExperiment` objects created during pre-processing steps with the `pmp` package.

### Overview

- Export files for GNPS from MS-DIAL.
- Upload and process you data on the GNPS website.
- Download your processed data.
- Import into R, clean the data, and append the names to your `SummarizedExperiment` objects.

## Method

### Data export for GNPS from MS-DIAL

Similar to exporting raw height matrices from MS-DIAL, you can export data for GNPS by selecting the `GNPS export` checkbox (deselect
the `Raw data matrix (Height)` checkbox).

To get the correct output, you will also need to set the `Target file` to one of the QC or sample files. For simplicity, select the
same QC file as you used during the MS-DIAL data processing parameters.

Then you can click export, and the data will be in the selected directory.

### Running your data on GNPS

Navigate to the [Superquick Start page](https://gnps-quickstart.ucsd.edu/featurebasednetworking), enter an email address to be notified
of completion, and enter your GNPS login credentials. Then set the `Feature Generation Tool` option to "MS-Dial".

You need to provide files to each of the top two boxes:

- `Drop file here to upload feature quantification table`
- `Drop file here to upload feature MS2 MGF/MSP/mzML file(s)`

In the first box, drop in your "GnpsTable_xyz.txt" file (this will typically have the largest file size). In the second box, drop
in your "GnpsMgf_xyz.mgf" file.

Then press the `Analyze Uploaded Files with GNPS Feature Based Molecular Networking` button to run the workflow.

### Retrieving the data output

Once your job has completed, you will see a green window with multiple download/viewing options.

To download your data for integration of names with your existing `SummarizedExperiment` objects, you will need to click the link beneath
`Export/Download Network Files` (it will say `Download Cytoscape Data`.

This will take you to a new screen where you can download your data (leave all parameters as they are).

### Rename results file and convert to .csv

Unzip your downloaded file and navigate to the `DB_result` folder.
This should contain a single .tsv file with a long name which can be renamed to something you will recognise.

Optionally, open this file with excel and save it as a .csv file, then copy the file to somewhere within the scope of your R project,
e.g. `/data/gnps/gnps_stool_positive.csv`.

### Import data into R

You should have GNPS output files for both your positive and negative ionisation modes.
What we want to do now, is to produce a new column of values (most will be `NA`) for the `rowData` element of our `SummarizedExperiment` objects.

The naming of the metabolite features from GNPS is very messy however (given that there are many community-provided features), with different
styles. Some of these may come from MoNA, Massbank, ReSpect etc., and there are extra tags on the names that we can remove for clarity.

#### Cleaning up the naming

To clean up the names, and produce a new column that looks nice, we can use the function `gnps_format_names()` provided above.

It takes two input files (`gnps_pos_df` and `gnps_neg_df`), and returns a single combined data.frame with a new column named
`compound_name_gnps` with our cleaned feature names.

Also of note, it generates another new column called `alignment_ionisation` which contains the alignment IDs and ionisation modes that match
with our outputs from `pmp_preprocess()`; this will be necessary for the next step.

Below is an example with stool metabolomics data output from GNPS:

```r
# Import GNPS data
gnps_stool_pos <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'gnps', 'gnps_data', 'gnps_20210727_stool_positive.csv'))
gnps_stool_neg <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'gnps', 'gnps_data', 'gnps_20210727_stool_negative.csv'))

# Format GNPS compound names and return a joined pos and neg data.frame
gnps_stool <- gnps_format_names(gnps_pos_df = gnps_stool_pos, gnps_neg_df = gnps_stool_neg)
```

The `gnps_stool` data.frame now contains our cleaned names and alignment IDs/ionisation modes.

### Appending GNPS names to SummarizedExperiment objects

The next step is to incorporate our new GNPS names with our existing data. 
For this, we will need a vector the same length as the number of features remaining after pre-processing with `pmp`,
with GNPS names matched by their alignment IDs and ionisation mode.

We can achieve this using the `gnps_SE_names()` feature provided above. 
It takes two inputs: 
- `gnps_df`: i.e. the output from `gnps_format_names()` (must contain columns named `'alignment_ionisation'` and `'compound_name_gnps'`).
- `metab_SE`: one of the two `SummarizedExperiment` objects within the `pmp_preprocess()` output list; these can be accessed using standard list notation, e.g. `pmp_output$glog_results`.

```r
# Add the GNPS compound names to both the glog-transformed and imputed SE objects
rowData(metab_stool_pmp$glog_results)$compound_name_gnps <- gnps_SE_names(gnps_df = gnps_stool, 
                                                                          metab_SE = metab_stool_pmp$glog_results)
rowData(metab_stool_pmp$imputed_results)$compound_name_gnps <- gnps_SE_names(gnps_df = gnps_stool,
                                                                             metab_SE = metab_stool_pmp$imputed_results)
```

Now these new names will be available within the `rowData` element of each of our `SummarizedExperiment` objects, and can be
accessed using `rowData(SE_object)$compound_name_gnps`.

## Explanation of functions

### gnps_format_names()

This function takes two input parameters: `gnps_pos_df` and `gnps_neg_df`. These are the output files from the `DB_results` folder - each contains 35 columns as of version release_18. Importantly, they contain a column named `#SCAN#` (corresponds to the alignment ID of the MS-DIAL output) and another named `Compound_Name`.
These columns will be used to generate the new `rowData` parameter for your `SummarizedExperiment` objects.

By assigning the result of `gnps_format_names()` to a variable, you will also retain all of the additional feature information in case you need to reference it again. You will be able to determine the correct GNPS-mapped feature using the alignment ID and the ionisation mode of the feature in your `SummarizedExperiment` object.

#### Feature functionality

The function firstly loads the required packages in case they are not already loaded. It requires the following packages are installed in your environment:

- `data.table`
- `tidyverse`
- `SummarizedExperiment`
- `S4Vectors`
- `stringr`

An inner function (`gnps_remove_tags()`) is defined that will handle the removal of various extraneous text information from the compound names.
Because GNPS maps your MS/MS data to compound information from various sources, the naming can be quite convoluted.
The `gnps_remove_tags()` function removes this extra text, e.g. 'Spectral Match to /compound/ from NIST14' will return '/compound/'.
Currently, it can remove the extra text from NIST14, ReSpect, Massbank, and MoNA derived compounds, and remove any eV information from the end of the names.

Next, the first columns in the GNPS data, i.e. `'#SCAN#'`, are renamed to `'Alignment.ID'`. 
The `'Compound_Name'` columns are copied to new columns called `'compound_name_gnps'`, which then have the `gnps_remove_tags()` function run on them.

The text in `compound_name_gnps` is formatted to title case using the `stringr` function `str_to_title()`, which capitalises the first letter of each word only.
Although this may lead to some undesirable changes (e.g. 'ATP' becoming 'Atp'), overall it improves naming uniformity. 
These values can be renamed downstream if necessary.

A new vector is then made from the `Alignment.ID` column of each data.frame by pasting either `'_pos'` or `'_neg'` to the end, and then concatenating the vectors together.

The individual data.frames are joined using `rbind`, and the vector from above is added as a new column: `'alignment_ionisation'`, as well as being used as the rownames.

The resulting data.frame is returned from the function.

### gnps_SE_names()

This function takes two input parameters: `gnps_df` and `metab_SE`. `gnps_df` is the output data.frame from the `gnps_format_names()` function, and `metab_SE` is one of your `SummarizedExperiment` objects.
A new `rowData` element will be appended so that your new annotation data does not affect the compound annotations already provided by MS-DIAL.

#### Feature functionality

The function firstly loads the required packages in case they are not already loaded. It requires the following packages are installed in your environment:

- `data.table`
- `tidyverse`
- `SummarizedExperiment`
- `S4Vectors`

A temporary data.frame is generated from the metabolite feature information data element of your `SummarizedExperiment` object.
The rownames of this data.frame are added to a new column; these will be used to match the `'alignment_ionisation'` column of the `gnps_df` object.

```r
# Get the metabolite feature info data from SE object
metab_info_temp <- as.data.frame(metab_SE@elementMetadata@listData)
metab_info_temp$alignment_ionisation <- rownames(metab_info_temp)
```

The `'alignment_ionisation'` and `'compound_name_gnps'` columns are selected from the `gnps_df` object, and matched to the metabolite information data.frame using a `left_join()`.

The `'compound_name_gnps'` column from this joined data.frame is then returned from the function.

For efficiency, this function can be used directly in the definition of your new `rowData` element:

```r
# Add the GNPS compound names to your metabolite SE object
rowData(metab_SE)$compound_name_gnps <- gnps_SE_names(gnps_df, metab_SE)
```
